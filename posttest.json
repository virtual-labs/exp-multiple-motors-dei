        "a": "DC Motor",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "DC Motors are typically used for continuous rotation, not for precise angular positioning.",
        "b": "Servo motors are designed specifically for precise control of angular position and are commonly used in Arduino projects.",
        "c": "Stepper motors offer precise stepwise movement, but servo motors are better suited for angular position control.",
        "d": "Brushless DC motors are more efficient but require complex control mechanisms, unlike servo motors."

    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of using a motor driver like L298N with DC motors in Arduino projects?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To increase the voltage supplied to the motor.",
        "b": "To control the speed and direction of the motor.",
        "c": "To reduce the power consumption of the motor.",
        "d": "To amplify the PWM signal for faster motor operation."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Motor drivers like L298N are not used to increase the voltage; they are used to control the motor's direction and speed.",
        "b": "L298N allows you to control both the direction and speed of a DC motor by using digital signals and PWM.",
        "c": "Motor drivers like L298N don't reduce the power consumption but rather regulate the motor's operation.",
        "d": "Motor drivers like L298N are designed to control the motor's direction and speed, not specifically to amplify the PWM signal."

      "question": "Which motor is ideal for applications requiring precise stepwise rotation, such as in CNC machines or 3D printers?",

        "a": "DC Motor",
        "b": "Servo Motor",
        "c": "Stepper Motor",
        "d": "Brushless DC Motor"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "DC motors do not provide precise stepwise rotation and are generally used for continuous motion.",
        "b": "Servo motors are good for angular positioning but do not offer stepwise rotation like stepper motors.",
        "c": "Stepper motors are ideal for precise stepwise rotation and are commonly used in applications like CNC machines and 3D printers.",
        "d": "Brushless DC motors are more efficient but not suitable for stepwise movement like stepper motors."

    {
      "question": "In Arduino, how is the direction of a DC motor typically controlled?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "By controlling the PWM signal on the motor pin.",
        "b": "By switching the motor's power supply.",
        "c": "By using an H-Bridge or motor driver like L298N.",
        "d": "By changing the servo position."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "PWM controls the speed of the motor, not the direction.",
        "b": "Switching the power supply doesn't reliably control the direction of the motor.",
        "c": "The direction of a DC motor is controlled by switching the input pins of an H-Bridge or motor driver like L298N.",
        "d": "Servo motors are used for angular positioning, not for controlling DC motor direction."
