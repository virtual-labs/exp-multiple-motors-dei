### Procedure for the experiment is as follows:

1. Open the experiment in the virtual lab for interfacing multiple motors.  
   The Arduino board and all motors (DC motor, servo motor, and stepper motor) are already connected in the workspace.

2. Observe the circuit connections.  
   Study the wiring for each motor, including motor driver connections for DC/stepper motors and signal pin for the servo motor.  
   Identify the control pins, power supply lines, and ground connections.

3. Open and review the Arduino code.  
   Read the predefined code to understand how PWM signals control the DC motor speed, how angles are set for the servo motor, and how step control is implemented for the stepper motor.

4. Start the simulation.  
   Click the "Start Simulation" button to run the setup.  
   Observe the rotation of the DC motor, the angular movement of the servo, and the step-wise rotation of the stepper motor.

5. Interact with the simulation if required.  
   Some motor behaviors may follow predefined speed or angle sequences based on the code.  
   Monitor how changes in code variables or delays affect motor speed and movement patterns.

6. Record observations.  
   Note the speed variation of the DC motor, the exact angle movement of the servo, and the stepping accuracy of the stepper motor.

7. Stop the simulation.  
   Click the "Stop Simulation" button after observing all motor operations.
