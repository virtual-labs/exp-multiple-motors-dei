      "question": "Which motor requires a motor driver like L298N for controlling direction and speed in an Arduino project?",

        "a": "DC Motor",
        "b": "Servo Motor",
        "c": "Stepper Motor",
        "d": "All of the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "DC motors require a motor driver like L298N to control direction and speed using PWM.",
        "b": "Servo motors do not require a motor driver but are controlled by PWM signals.",
        "c": "Stepper motors often require a driver like ULN2003 or A4988 for controlling steps and direction.",
        "d": "Not all of these motors require a motor driver like L298N. Servo motors don't require one."

      "question": "What is the primary advantage of using a stepper motor in Arduino projects?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Stepper motors are faster than DC motors.",

        "d": "Stepper motors require less power than DC motors."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Stepper motors are not necessarily faster but are precise in their rotations.",
        "b": "The primary advantage of stepper motors is their ability to provide precise control over rotation angle without feedback systems.",
        "c": "Stepper motors are generally more expensive than DC motors due to their precision.",
        "d": "Stepper motors tend to consume more power than DC motors due to their stepwise operation."

    {
      "question": "In Arduino, how is the direction of a DC motor typically controlled?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "By controlling the PWM signal on the motor pin.",
        "b": "By switching the motor's power supply.",
        "c": "By using an H-Bridge or motor driver like L298N.",
        "d": "By changing the servo position."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "PWM controls the speed of the motor, not the direction.",
        "b": "Switching the power supply does not reliably control the direction of the motor.",
        "c": "The direction of a DC motor is controlled by switching pins on an H-Bridge or using a motor driver like L298N.",
        "d": "Servo motors are used for angular positioning, not for controlling DC motor direction."
