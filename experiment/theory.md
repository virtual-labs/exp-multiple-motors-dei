Interfacing motors with Arduino is a common task in robotics and automation projects. Motors are used for various applications, and each motor type has different characteristics and control methods. Here's an overview of the three types of motors commonly interfaced with Arduino.A DC motor is a type of electric motor that runs on direct current (DC) electricity. 

It has two main terminals: one for positive and one for negative voltage. The motor’s speed and direction can be controlled using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) and an H-Bridge circuit to control the direction.A servo motor is used for precise control of angular position. It includes a built-in feedback mechanism that allows it to rotate to a specific angle. A stepper motor rotates in discrete steps, providing precise control over rotation angle without the need for feedback systems. Stepper motors are controlled by sending a series of pulses to the motor’s coils.
