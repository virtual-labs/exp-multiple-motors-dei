<b> Experiment|     <b> To simulate interfacing of multiple motors (DC Motor, Servo Motor and Stepper Motor) with Arduino.

### About the Experiment 

This experiment focuses on simulating the interfacing of different types of motors with the Arduino microcontroller.  
It demonstrates how electrical energy is converted into controlled mechanical motion using embedded programming.  
Students learn speed control of DC motors, position control of servo motors, and step sequencing of stepper motors.  
The experiment introduces concepts such as PWM, motor drivers, and rotational control mechanisms.  
The simulation provides practical understanding of motion control systems used in robotics and IoT-based automation.
